Silverstripe Commerce Stock Keeping
===================================

Module designed to add basic stock keeping to the CMS. All products can
be given a "stock level". Once a user pays for the particular
product the stock level is reduced by the quantity of the ordered items. 

At the moment this is pretty rudimentory and only updates stock levels
when an order object is saved. This probably should be improved in the
future, maybe one mechanism that can be linked to from whenever a user
places an order.
